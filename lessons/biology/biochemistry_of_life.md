## Biochemistry of Life

### Goal(s):

1. To understand the basic components and forces found in biological macromolecules.
1. To understand that, despite their different levels of organization, all organisms are comprised of cells, the basic unit of life.
1. To understand that a cell and its various sub-cellular structures are comprised of four major classes of macromolecules: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (discussed later in the course).
1. To understand the general structure of lipids and phospholipids and how this structure dictates function.
1. To understand the general structure of simple and complex carbohydrate molecules and how this structure dictates function.
1. To understand the general structure of ATP.

### Objectives: Students should be able to...

1. List the most common elements found in biological macromolecules and describe the properties of these atoms.
1. Describe electronegativity and electron affinity.
1. Predict the effects of electronegativity and electron affinity on molecular interactions.
1. Identify the types of bonds or forces between different interacting groups.
1. Explain how hydrogen bonds are formed.
1. Give examples of the importance of hydrogen bonds in biological systems.
1. Design molecules with particular properties (e.g. hydrophilic) that can make particular types of bonds (e.g. hydrogen, ionic).
1. Describe the role that phospholipids and carbohydrates have in a cell.
1. Describe how the basic components and forces dictate the structure and function of phospholipids and carbohydrates.
1. Identify the basic building blocks of membranes, carbohydrates, and proteins.
1. Draw the basic building blocks of membranes and carbohydrates.
1. Explain why ATP is a high-energy molecule that can provide the energy to power cellular work.


### Notes

Humans are made out of mostly the following 6 atoms:
+ H - hydrogen 63%
+ O - oxygen 24%
+ C - carbon 10%
+ N - nitrogen 1.4%
+ P - phosphorus 0.2%
+ S - sulfur  < 0.1%
and trace amounts of 
+ Ca - calcuim
+ Chloride 
+ Se - selenium
+ K - potassium
+ Na - Sodium
+ Magnesium
+ Manganese

Human dry weight:
+ protein 50%
+ carbohydrate 15%
+ lipids and fats 10%
+ nucliec acids 15%


Covalent bonds are shared pairs of electrons, very strong bonds.
Covalent bond type: single, double, and triple.
Bond strength is calculated by Kilocalories.
