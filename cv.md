### Personal Statement

Computing technology is becoming more integral to every walk of life with every passing day. Tools are being created on a daily basis to support human tasks and need improvement, re-imagining, and replacing. There are multiple areas of computing inquiry with humongous unexplored areas, and wide explored areas to which ones' imagination can be put to bare. Sparking the imaginations of others with technical leadership while pursuing technical improvement with scientific discovery is what I am doing with my career.
